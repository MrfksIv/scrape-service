# TRG Coding Assessment
## Part 1 
### Prerequisites
- Before using the service you will need to have Node.js ( >= v12.13) installed on your system. 
- You will need to add a valid google maps API key in the .env file under the `G_MAPS_API_KEY` This was sent in a separate email since the repository is public.
### Starting the service
- From the terminal run `npm start`.
- To compile the Javascript `.js` files from the Typescript `.ts` source files use the command `npm run build`.

### Running the Unit Tests
- From the terminal run `npm run test`.


### API Documentation
After the service is running you can view the swagger docs of the API by navigating to the url:
http://localhost:3000/api-docs.

If the default port 3000 has been changed from the `.env` file use that one instead.

## Part 2 Questions

#### Which of the people above are most likely good friends?
Jim and Robert were close( <= 2m apart) on 2 separate occasions during football matches on 10/01/2020 and 22/12/2020

#### Where is Jim likely to be in the evening of 15.02.2020?
No Omonoia match on that date, (APOEL was playing in GSP [link](https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/cyp-first-division-2019-2020-spieltag/20/)).
So probably at home or out with friends since it is a Saturday - very limited info to go on!  

#### Where possibly was John in the evening of 15.01.2020?
On 8.1.2020 he was in the commercial downtown area of Paphos. One could assume that
this is where he works. So a week later it is likely he will be at the same place
since it is a weekday.

#### Where possibly was Robert in the morning of 18.01.2020?
A week before that he was at a Krav Maga class so if this is a weekly class there is a
good chance he will be there.

#### What do you believe is the marital status of Robert? (BONUS)
He was at a  kids place on 13.01.2020 so one could assume that probably he is or has been married.

#### What other intel could you infer about John and Robert? (BONUS)
John supports PaphosFC while Robert supports Omonoia (match details [here](https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/cyp-first-division-2019-2020-spieltag/16/))

#### Which band could those 3 people have formed? (BONUS)
Head Band ???
